# No Serve: AngularJs Seed

A project seed for a lightweight angularjs app that does not require a build tool or an http server.

Basic seed project used for very small applications. Css relies on automatic less compilation through the Atom editor ([less-autocompile](https://atom.io/packages/less-autocompile))

Run project simply by opening [index.html](/index.html) inside a browser.

If you want to build anything more heavyweight use the [AngularJS Seed](https://github.com/EmandM/angularjs-seed) project.
